After naming/designing our database in schema.sql and mysql...

connection.js uses Sequelize to set up our app to connect to our db.

This code is the initial setup for connection.js:

    // import the Sequelize constructor from the library
    const Sequelize = require('sequelize');

    // create connection to our database, pass in your MySQL information for username and password
    const sequelize = new Sequelize('just_tech_news_db', 'username', 'password', {
      host: 'localhost',
      dialect: 'mysql',
      port: 3306
    });

    module.exports = sequelize;

Problem is, it'll show our username and password if pushed to github.
So we install dotenv, and use a .env to store stuff for us that won't be pushed!

Make our .env file, store our passwords and such, put it in our gitignore!
