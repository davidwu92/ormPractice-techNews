Part 4:

1. db created.
2. connection established using sequelize; variables hidden from public using .env file and dotenv package.
3. first model, "user", created. Has four columns: id, username, email, password.

Let's write routes that work with User model to perform CRUD.
These are going into routes/api/user-routes.js

index.js files will package up our route files and prefix their URLs appropriately.

Routes in the api folder will manage our db's table CRUD operations.
