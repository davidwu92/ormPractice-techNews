PART 3: THE USER MODEL (before bcrypt pw auth)

Remember: a CLASS is a template for creating objects. They'll look like this:
    
    class ClassName {
        constructor() { ... }
        method_1() { ... }
        method_2() { ... }
      }
    }

Sequelize's model classes let us use JavaScript classes to define columns/data types for our tables.

This class will serve as a layer between the API and the database and will handle all transactions of data between the two.

We created a User model, which sets up the user table's columns and config.

We created index.js to organize models, exporting them as properties on an object.
