We created the Post models. Users can post with a title and URL (to a news article).

~~~ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN TABLES~~~

Posts have user_id, which references the "user" model at key "id":

    user_id: {
      type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
      references: {
        model: 'user',
        key: 'id'
      }
    }

User to Post: one to many relationship.
Create associations between tables in index.js:
    User.hasMany(Post, {foreignKey: 'user_id'}),
    Post.belongsTo(User, {foreignKey: 'user_id'})


Making these associations requires we drop and recreate our tables.
Do this by changing force: true in server.js and restarting the server.
