PART 9: VOTES AND THEIR ROUTES

Each vote has three columns: id, user_id, and post_id

When a user votes on a post, we'll get a new row on this table.


In models/index.js, we set up the many to many relationship.
  ~Each User belongsToMany Posts, and vice versa. This is through their votes.
  ~Each Vote belongsTo a User and belongsTo a Post.
  ~Each User and each Post hasMany Votes

In the routes, we set up voting routes INSIDE THE POST ROUTES (each vote is on a post!)
